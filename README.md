Your Online Identity

When choosing a username, it’s important not to reveal any personal information. It should be something appropriate and respectful and should not lead strangers to think you are an easy target for cybercrimes or unwanted attention.

Some other useful tips to help you generate your username: 

Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number.
Don’t use your email username.
Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to track.
Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of numbers/letters or the first part of a two-part phrase, such as knock-knock or starlight, or the department in which you work, such as IT.
Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or personal.
